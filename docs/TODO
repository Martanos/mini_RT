TODO:
1. Primary Ray Generation
   - Calculate camera ray direction for each pixel
   - Apply camera transformation matrix

2. Intersection Testing
   - Test ray against all objects in scene
   - Find closest intersection point
   - Store intersection information (point, normal, material)

3. Material Property Gathering
   - Get base material color
   - Get texture coordinates at intersection point
   - Apply checkerboard pattern if specified
   - Sample bump/normal maps if present

4. Normal Calculation
   - Get geometric normal at intersection point
   - If bump map exists, perturb normal using height differences
   - If normal map exists, transform sampled normal to world space
   - Normalize final normal vector

5. Lighting Calculation (Phong Model)
   - For each light source:
     - Calculate light direction vector
     - Check for shadows (cast shadow ray)
     - Calculate diffuse component (Lambert's law)
     - Calculate specular component (Phong reflection)
     - Apply light attenuation based on distance
     - Accumulate light contributions

6. Specular Reflection
   - Calculate reflection direction using incident ray and surface normal
   - Cast reflection ray recursively (with depth limit)
   - Blend reflection color with local color based on material reflectivity

7. Texture Application
   - Map 3D intersection point to 2D texture coordinates
   - For checkerboard:
     - Scale and offset coordinates
     - Determine pattern color based on position
   - For image textures:
     - Sample texture at mapped coordinates
     - Apply texture filtering if needed

8. Final Color Composition
   - Combine all lighting components
   - Apply global illumination effects
   - Clamp final color values
   - Write to output buffer

Ray -> Intersection -> Lighting -> Final Color -> Put pixel
